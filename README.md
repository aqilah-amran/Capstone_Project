# Capstone_Project
R capstone project for the "Analysing Data with R" CodeCademy course.

This is my first ever project and the capstone project for Codecademy's "Analyse data with R" course. 
In it, I make use of what I've learnt throughout the course on data manipulation, data visualisation and building linear regression models to analyse
the how the popularity of Apple's products affects the company's stock prices.
